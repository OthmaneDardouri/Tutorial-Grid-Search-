# Decision Trees with GridSearch: Combat Overfitting with Scikit-Learn

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use decision trees with scikit-learn and apply GridSearch to combat overfitting. While this tutorial focuses on decision trees, the concepts and methods demonstrated are easily extensible to other machine learning models.

## Dataset

For this tutorial, we will use the famous Iris dataset, which includes five predictor variables and one target variable. The dataset is well-suited for visualization and understanding basic concepts in classification.

## Tutorial and Code

We will begin by using libraries like Seaborn to visualize the data. Visualizing correlations and data distributions relative to the target variable can help uncover patterns and improve our understanding. For smaller datasets like the Iris dataset, identifying patterns is relatively straightforward. However, for larger datasets, this may not be as simple.

The key focus of this tutorial will be to show how to use GridSearch to find the best hyperparameters for a decision tree model, which can help mitigate overfitting. Once you master this, you can easily extend this technique to other models.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (preferably version 3.x)

scikit-learn: To install, run pip install scikit-learn

pandas: To install, run pip install pandas

seaborn: To install, run pip install seaborn

matplotlib: To install, run pip install matplotlib

Basic knowledge of Python and familiarity with data manipulation using pandas will be helpful but not necessary.

## Key Takeaways

Understanding how to visualize data with Seaborn

Building and evaluating a decision tree classifier

Using GridSearch to optimize hyperparameters and prevent overfitting

Applying these techniques to other models for better performance

Enjoy the tutorial and have fun learning how to build more robust machine learning models!
